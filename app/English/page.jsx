              `Serverless mobile application developed with React Native, which uses Artificial 
              Intelligence to recognize bags of potatoes on a shelf through photographs. 
              The AI implementation was done using technologies like SkLearn and Keras, among others. 
              Participation included training the AI model as well as designing and developing the 
              user experience and interface (UX/UI).`

            description="In this project, a team of approximately 30 Computer Technology Engineers came together to develop an innovative web platform. We utilized technologies such as AWS, GCP, and Flask to create the website, with React.js on the front-end and Node.js on the back-end. The database was managed using MongoDB. My primary contribution focused on the back-end development, where I established routes and connections with the database to display real-time auctions, along with car details. I also actively participated in designing the business model and contributed to the front-end, particularly in the deployment of images and formatting of tables and prices."

            description="A syntax highlighter in Python has been developed that can efficiently 
            process a large number of files (over 2000). These files are processed in parallel, 
            making use of the computer's multiple cores. Once they are processed by the tokenizer, 
            the results are displayed on a web page with syntax highlighting in colors corresponding to 
            each element."

            description="We developed a multi-agent system in Python using the Mesa library. In this 
            system, we designed a city that includes traffic lights and cars represented as automata. 
            Furthermore, we implemented a navigation system embedded in each car, similar to Waze, using
             the Dijkstra algorithm. The simulation was carried out in Unity in a three-dimensional 
             environment."

            description="We created a mobile application designed to provide assistance to the residents of 
            the Municipality of Atizapán. In the development of this application, we employed various 
            server-side technologies such as Node.js, Docker Compose, Firebase, Nginx, along with the 
            implementation of gRPC. For the user interface and user experience, we used Next.js, React.js, 
            and Tailwind CSS. As for the development of the mobile application itself, we chose Android Studio 
            and used C# as the programming language."
